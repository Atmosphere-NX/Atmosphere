Atmosphère is a work-in-progress customized firmware for the Nintendo Switch.

Components
=====

Atmosphère consists of multiple components, each of which replaces/modifies a different component of the system:

* Fusée: First-stage Loader, responsible for loading and validating stage 2 (custom TrustZone) plus package2 (Kernel/FIRM sysmodules), and patching them as needed. This replaces all functionality normally in Package1loader/NX Bootloader.
* Exosphère: Customized TrustZone, to run a customized Secure Monitor
* Thermosphère: EL2 EmuNAND support, i.e. backing up and using virtualized/redirected NAND images
* Stratosphère: Custom Sysmodule(s), both Rosalina style to extend the kernel/provide new features, and of the loader reimplementation style to hook important system actions
* Troposphère: Application-level Horizon OS patches, used to implement desirable CFW features
