# Building Atmosphère
The process for building Atmosphère is similar to building Fusée Gelée payloads and other Switch apps.

In order to build Atmosphère you must have devkitARM and devkitA64 installed on your computer. You can find instructions on how to install and setup devkitARM and devkitA64 on various OSes [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

Once you have finished installing devkitARM and devkitA64, simply clone the Atmosphère repo, change to it and run `make`.
