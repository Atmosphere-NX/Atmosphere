# Building Atmosphère
Building Atmosphère is a very straightforward process that relies almost exclusively on tools provided by the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) organization.

## Dependencies
+ [devkitA64](https://devkitpro.org)
+ [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org)
+ [Python 2](https://www.python.org) (Python 3 may work as well, but this is not guaranteed)
+ [PyCryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome) (optional)

## Instructions
1. Follow the guide located [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) to install and configure all the tools necessary for the build process. 
    1. `sudo apt-get install gdebi-core`
    1. `wget https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases/download/v1.0.2/devkitpro-pacman.amd64.deb`
    1. `sudo gdebi devkitpro-pacman.amd64.deb -y`

1. Sure that `zip` is installed. Instead `sudo apt-get install zip -y`

1. Install the following packages via `sudo dkp-pacman -S` :
    + `switch-dev`
    + `switch-glm`
    + `switch-libjpeg-turbo`
    + `devkitARM`
    + `devkitarm-rules`
    + `switch-glm`

1. Build and install master branch of libnx and needed extensions 

    + `git clone https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx.git`
    + `cd libnx`
    + `make install`
    + Unpack maked tar in `libnx/nx` to `opt/devkitpro/libnx`
    + `sudo apt install python-pip`
    + `sudo apt install python3-pip`
    + `pip install pycryptodome`
    + `pip install lz4==0.10.0`

1. It is, instead, possible to build [sept](components/sept.md) by providing previously encrypted/signed binaries distributed by official Atmosphère release packages. In order to do so, export the following variables in your current environment (`sudo nano /etc/environment`):
    + `SEPT_00_ENC_PATH` (must point to the `sept-secondary_00.enc` file)
    + `SEPT_01_ENC_PATH` (must point to the `sept-secondary_01.enc` file)
    + `SEPT_DEV_00_ENC_PATH` (must point to the `sept-secondary_dev_00.enc` file)
    + `SEPT_DEV_01_ENC_PATH` (must point to the `sept-secondary_dev_01.enc` file)

    + `export SEPT_00_ENC_PATH="~/sept/sept-secondary_00.enc"`
    + `export SEPT_01_ENC_PATH="~/sept/sept-secondary_01.enc"`
    + `export SEPT_DEV_00_ENC_PATH="~/sept/sept-secondary_dev_00.enc"`
    + `export SEPT_DEV_01_ENC_PATH="~/sept/sept-secondary_dev_01.enc"`

1. Finally, clone the Atmosphère repository and run `make` under its root directory.
