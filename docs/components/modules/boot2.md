# boot2
This module is a reimplementation of the Horizon OS's `boot2` system module, which is responsible for launching all the other necessary system modules.

Atmosph√®re's reimplementation allows launching user provided system modules from the SD card. See [here](../../features/configurations.md) for more information.
