# pgl
This module is a reimplementation of the Horizon OS's `pgl` system module, which is responsible for launching programs and was introduced by firmware version `10.0.0`.

Currently, Atmosph√®re's reimplementation doesn't backport this module's functionalities to firmware versions lower than `10.0.0`.
